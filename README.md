> This mod requires adding the frames you want to appear in the death screen manually.
> However, if you have Python installed, this is quite easy:
>
> 1. rename the jar into a zip and extract its contents to a new directory
> 2. drag the PNG-s into the `assets/deathscreenframes/frames` subdirectory in it
> 3. run the `make-framelist.py` script in the root directory
>
> Then, repackage the folder into a .zip and rename it to a .jar file.
>
> If you don't have Python installed, filling the `framelist.txt` file might be tricky
> or take some time. However, installing Python is quite easy - Google shall say.
